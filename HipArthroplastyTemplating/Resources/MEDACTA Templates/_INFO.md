These templates are NOT always the original files provided by MEDACTA:

* Some PDFs were modified so the lines are thicker than in the original versions.
* Some TXTs were modified so the different stems don't show as a single family.
  * ORIENTATION info was added to some files
  * names of related PDFs were fixed in some files
