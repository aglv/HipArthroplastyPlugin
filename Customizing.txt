You will be able to add your own templates to the plugin: add a folder  
"My Templates" (it must end with "Templates") to the plugin's  
Resources directory, and inside that folder use the same structure as  
in the MEDACTA Templates folder:
- every implant has a TXT file and one or two PDF files (anterior/ 
posterior, lateral) for every available size
- the txt file contains values for: FIXATION_TYPE, PRODUCT_GROUP,  
IMPLANT_MANUFACTURER, MODULARITY_INFO, PRODUCT_FAMILY_NAME,  
TYPE_OF_SURGERY, COMPONENT_TYPE, SIZE, REF_NO,  
PDF_FILE_AP, PDF_FILE_ML
- coordinates of "origin" in the pdf (rotation point for cups, center  
for stems): AP_ORIGIN_X, AP_ORIGIN_Y, ML_ORIGIN_X, ML_ORIGIN_Y,
- in stem, coordinates of the different neck-length rotation points  
(fixed points common with the cup): AP_HEAD_ROTATION_POINT_1_X, ....,  
ML_HEAD_ROTATION_POINT_5_Y (1 is interpreted as XS, then S, M, L, XL)
- LEFT_RIGHT says which leg the product is for: "RIGHT", "LEFT",
"LEFT AND RIGHT", "BOTH"
- for products that aren't usable on both legs, OTHER_SIDE_REF_NO says 
which product is to be used for the other leg
- ORIENTATION indicates the leg for which the template is drawn on the
original PDF. 
- AP_HEAD_ROTATION_RADS indicates by how many radiants the object is 
already rotated on the PDF, so if your product is shown vertically then use 0

Late versions of the plugin also load templates from all folders ending with 
Templates in /Library/Application Support/OsiriX/HipArthroplastyTemplating
and ~/Library/Application Support/OsiriX/HipArthroplastyTemplating, so you
don;t need to modify the plugin, you can just distribute a package that 
installs your templates there.

The plugin also supports proximal/distal stems, contact us if you want more 
information about this.
