You will be able to add your own templates to the plugin: add a folder  
"My Templates" (it must end with "Templates") to the plugin's  
Resources directory, and inside that folder use the same structure as  
the included MEDACTA Templates data:
- every implant has a TXT file and one or two PDF files (anterior/ 
posterior, lateral) for every available size
- the txt file contains values for: FIXATION_TYPE, PRODUCT_GROUP,  
IMPLANT_MANUFACTURER, MODULARITY_INFO, PRODUCT_FAMILY_NAME,  
LEFT_RIGHT, TYPE_OF_SURGERY, COMPONENT_TYPE, SIZE, REF_NO,  
PDF_FILE_AP, PDF_FILE_ML
- coordinates of "origin" in the pdf (rotation point for cups, center  
for stems): AP_ORIGIN_X, AP_ORIGIN_Y, ML_ORIGIN_X, ML_ORIGIN_Y,
- in stem, coordinates of the different neck-length rotation points  
(fixed points common with the cup): AP_HEAD_ROTATION_POINT_1_X, ....,  
ML_HEAD_ROTATION_POINT_5_Y (1 is interpreted as XS, then S, M, L, XL)
- ORIENTATION indicates the leg for which the template is drawn on the
PDF.
